JSON Parameter Documentation:

species_grid (array): List of species entries.

Each species entry is an object with the following keys:
  - "class": string
      The category of the entity (e.g., "Tree", "Prey", "Rock", etc.)
  - "species": string
      Specific species name (e.g., "Conifer", "Rabbit", "Granite", etc.)
  - "position": object
      Contains:
          "x": number (float) - X-coordinate
          "y": number (float) - Y-coordinate
          "z": number (float) - Z-coordinate
  - "hunger": number (float)
      Hunger level, typically between 0.0 and 1.0.
  - "water": number (float)
      Water level, typically between 0.0 and 1.0.
  - "sleep": number (float)
      Sleep/rest level, typically between 0.0 and 1.0.
  - "gender": number (float)
      A numerical encoding of gender (could be a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
  - "mood": array
      A 4-element array representing mood values.
  - "generation": number (integer)
      The generation number.
  - "energy": number (float)
      Energy level.
  - "age": number (integer)
      Age in simulation time units.
  - "reproduction_rate": number (float)
      Rate or threshold for reproduction.
  - "aggression": number (float)
      Aggression level.
  - "mutation_rate": number (float)
      Mutation rate.
  - "music_taste": string
      A categorical descriptor (e.g., "punk", "techno", etc.).
  - "geometry": object (optional)
      Contains visual model information for the entity.
      For example, for a Tree, you might include:
          "trunk": object with keys:
              "model": string (e.g., "cube")
              "color": string (e.g., "brown")
              "initial_scale": array of 3 numbers [x, y, z]
              "max_scale": array of 3 numbers [x, y, z]
              "position": array of 3 numbers [x, y, z]
          "foliage": object with similar keys as "trunk".
      You can add additional parts as needed.
